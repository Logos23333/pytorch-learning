    "Exercise: Augmenting the LSTM part-of-speech tagger with character-level features ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, each word had an embedding, which served as the inputs to our sequence model. Let's augment the word embeddings with a representation derived from the characters of the word. We expect that this should help significantly, since character-level information like affixes have a large bearing on part-of-speech. For example, words with the affix -ly are almost always tagged as adverbs in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let  𝑐𝑤  be the character-level representation of word  𝑤 . Let  𝑥𝑤  be the word embedding as before. Then the input to our sequence model is the concatenation of  𝑥𝑤  and  𝑐𝑤 . So if  𝑥𝑤  has dimension 5, and  𝑐𝑤  dimension 3, then our LSTM should accept an input of dimension 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the character level representation, do an LSTM over the characters of a word, and let  𝑐𝑤  be the final hidden state of this LSTM. Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are going to be two LSTM's in your new model. The original one that outputs POS tag scores, and the new one that outputs a character-level representation of each word.\n",
    "To do a sequence model over characters, you will have to embed characters. The character embeddings will be the input to the character LSTM."
